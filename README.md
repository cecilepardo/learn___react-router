# learn___react-router

This project was created to practice using routing in a React application.

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to learn and experiment with:
- setting up routes in React using React Router
- navigating between pages/components
- passing parameters through routes
- handling nested routes
- managing 404 / fallback pages

This project is part of my learning process.

## What I practiced

- Installing and configuring React Router
- Creating multiple routes and linking components
- Using `useParams`, `useNavigate` and other hooks
- Handling nested and dynamic routes
- Displaying a fallback page for unmatched routes

## Status

This is a learning project and is not intended
